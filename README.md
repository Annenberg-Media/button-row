This repository is made by Web Team of USC Annenberg Media (https://uscannenbergmedia.com), to work on features without getting involved in the Arc local build process (which is supposedly deprecated soon).

- common
Common utility files, just import them as needed

- sample-pages
Has HTML copies of some AM articles to work with while building features

- features
Each folder should have HTML/CSS/Javascript related to that feature only, less dependencies across features is better for maintenance

Can we deploy and host these features remotely, which Arc can just fetch?
